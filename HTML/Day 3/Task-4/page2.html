    <br>
    <p>Computer keyboards typically can be grouped into two main categories: basic or extended keyboards. Within these two classes are many different types of keyboards, which offer a variety of features. Different types of keyboard technology also exist, such as scissor switch keyboards (common on notebooks and netbooks) and full press membrane keyboards (common for desktop computers). The different keyboard technologies allow for varying user experiences, such as how hard a key must be pressed to convey the message to type a character.</p>
